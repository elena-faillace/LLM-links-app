# LLM-links-app

Work in progress...

Plan for Command Line Interface (CLI) app:
1. Save salected URLs in a database
2. Embed the content of these URLs and save the results in the database
3. Use the embedded content with an LLM model to retreive URLs given a prompt

This app will allow me to search through my library of saved web pages using not only exact keywords, but understanding the context of my prompt.
